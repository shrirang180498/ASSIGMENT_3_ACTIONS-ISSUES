## Features

1. Categorized Training Questions
   - Developers can classify questions by subject, difficulty, and tags.
   - A user-friendly UI for easy categorization and tagging.
   - Questions and answers are stored separately for self-affirmation.

2. Balanced Training Data
   - Bias detection algorithm to identify racial, gender, and cultural biases.
   - Dashboard to visualize data distribution across categories.
   - Tools to filter or modify datasets to reduce biases.

3. System Scalability
   - Handles large datasets (millions of questions and answers) efficiently.
   - Supports parallel processing for faster data classification and analysis.

4. Data Protection
   - Encrypts data in transit and at rest.
   - Implements access control to restrict data access to authorized developers.

5. Integration with Web Scraping Tools
   - Seamlessly integrates with existing web scraping tools.
   - Supports multiple data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) for easy import/export.
