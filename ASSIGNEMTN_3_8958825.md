# Assignment 3: Actionable Items  
**Course:** SENG8091-25W-Sec1-Software Engineering Principles  

---

## Project Overview  
This assignment focuses on transforming the requirements from **Assignment 2** into actionable, well-structured tasks. The goal is to create a clear implementation plan that aligns with the client’s needs and ensures the system is scalable, secure, and user-friendly.

## Requirements Breakdown - (From ASSIGNEMTN 2): 
The requirements have been categorized into **Functional** and **System** requirements, ensuring a comprehensive approach to addressing the client’s challenges.  

### **Functional Requirements**  
1. **Categorized Training Questions:**  
   - Developers must be able to classify training questions by **subject, difficulty, and tags**.  
   - A **user-friendly interface (UI)** should be developed to simplify the categorization and tagging process.  
   - Questions and answers must be stored separately to support developer self-affirmation.  

2. **Balanced Training Data:**  
   - The system must include tools to detect and analyze **biases** (e.g., racial, gender, cultural) in the training data.  
   - A **dashboard** should be created to visualize data distribution across categories, helping developers identify and address imbalances.  
   - Developers should have the ability to **filter or modify** the dataset to reduce biases and ensure fairness.  

### **System Requirements**  
1. **Scalability:**  
   - The system must efficiently handle **large datasets** (millions of questions and answers) without performance degradation.  
   - **Parallel processing** capabilities should be implemented to accelerate data classification and analysis tasks.  

2. **Data Protection:**  
   - All data must be **encrypted** both in transit and at rest to ensure security and compliance with privacy standards.  
   - An **access control system** should be implemented to restrict data access to authorized developers only.  

3. **Integration with Web Scraping Tools:**  
   - The system must integrate seamlessly with the client’s existing **web scraping tools**.  
   - Support for **multiple data formats** (e.g., CSV, JSON) should be included to facilitate easy data import and export.
